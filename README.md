# Voter-Election-Data
Voter-Election-Data is a large-scale data science project focused on analyzing voter turnout patterns using cloud-scale tools and advanced analytics. The pipeline was built with Databricks, BigQuery, and PySpark, enabling the cleaning, transformation, and integration of millions of voter records into a centralized cloud-hosted database. After ETL processing, the project explored turnout behavior across key demographic and geographic dimensions including age, county, ethnicity, and household size, uncovering meaningful differences in participation rates. Visualizations such as choropleth maps and turnout by age group plots were developed to highlight statewide and county-level trends. Beyond descriptive analysis, the project applied predictive modeling to study drivers of turnout and unsupervised learning methods to cluster voter groups, providing new insight into underlying participation patterns. This work demonstrates how big data platforms, scalable ETL pipelines, and machine learning can be combined to generate actionable insights into electoral behavior.
